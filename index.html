	<br><br><br>	Learning to program teaches you persistence
	When you learn computer programming, you start seeing problems in the light of solutions. Your brain starts functioning like that. When you encounter a problem after learning to program, you start envisioning the possible ways to solve it. You may even foresee some good results out of it. However hard the problem might seem, you become determined to act on it anyhow. You transform yourself into a solution-driven individual.
	
	Programmers have to think logically about a problem. Once you start learning how to code, you stop giving up on other difficult situations in your day-to-day life as well. You start trying over and over again. You become patient because you know there is always a solution. It just needs some more effort, just like it happens when you create a program, runs it, and debug it several times to reach the perfect solution.
	Computer programming is powerful. Even if you know just the basics of programming, you can imagine a lot of solutions and can work to solve your (and maybe the world’s) problems. Learn computer programming to feel the confidence of having this robust tool at your disposal. It’s amazing!
